# daily-gratitude-app

Daily Gratitude App is full-stack application that also lets you create art. This app keeps a record of journal like entires
using a NEDB database and Node.js server. Users can view their "logs"/history of entries as well. 

Kudos to Joey Lee who created the data-selfie-app which partly inspired this project.
