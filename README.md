# daily-gratitude-app

Daily Gratitude App is full-stack application that also lets you create a piece art. This app keeps a record of journal like entries susing a NEDB database, Node.js server, and a canvas built with p5 and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend. 
Users can view their "logs"/history of entries as well to look back at their experiences over time. 

Shout out to the p5 community and Daniel Shiffman. 
Kudos to Joey Lee who created the data-selfie-app which partly inspired this project.
