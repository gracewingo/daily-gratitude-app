# daily-gratitude-app

Daily Gratitude is a full-stack application where you can enter a mood, gratitude list, and create a piece of art. This app keeps a record of journal like entries using a NEDB database, Node.js server, a canvas built with p5 and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend. This app tracks location data using the Google geocoding API. 
Users can view their "logs"/history of entries as well to look back at their experiences over time. 

Shout out to the p5 community and Daniel Shiffman. 
Kudos to Joey Lee who created the data-selfie-app which partly inspired this project.
